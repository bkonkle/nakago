<p>With the release of Nakago v0.23, the project is pivoting away from the ambitious goal of a full-featured API framework, and towards a more streamlined dependency injection toolkit instead. The async Rust ecosystem is growing rapidly, and I haven't been able to devote enough time to Nakago to grow the application lifecycle and convenience features that I had originally envisioned. There are other projects that are doing a great job of providing these features - like <a href="https://loco.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loco</a>, <a href="https://github.com/http-rs/tide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tide</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SeaQL/seaography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seaography</a>, or <a href="https://salvo.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Salvo</a>.</p>
<p>What I haven't seen yet, however, is an async-first dependency injection container that is as lightweight and easy to work with as Nakago is, and doesn't require a lot of opaque macros or code generation. Nakago uses macros sparingly and takes advantage of Rust's <code>Any</code> dynamic typing tools to support a thread-safe, async-first dependency injection container that would work well with a variety of different Rust frameworks and team sizes.</p>
<p>I'll continue refining Nakago and adding features and integrations as I have need of them on side projects, and I'd love to collaborate with others who are interested in building a lightweight, async-first dependency injection toolkit for Rust.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>nakago</code> - Removed <code>Application</code>, <code>Hooks</code>, the <code>lifecycle::EventType</code> and <code>lifecycle::Events</code> enums. The <code>config</code> utilities were moved to <code>nakago-figment</code>.</li>
<li><code>nakago-axum</code> - Removed <code>AxumApplication</code>, <code>Route</code>, and <code>Routes</code> in favor of a more generic approach. Use the new <code>Inject</code> extractor to access dependencies in your Axum handlers.</li>
<li><code>nakago-warp</code> - Removed <code>WarpApplication</code>, <code>Route</code>, and <code>Routes</code> in favor of a more generic approach. Use the <code>with_injection()</code> Filter to access dependencies in your Warp handlers.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>nakago</code> - The tag-based container operations were previously the default mode of working with <code>Inject</code>. This proved to be more verbose and than necessary in most cases, however. The new default mode is to use the type-based operations, which are more ergonomic and easier to use. The tag-based operations are still available, but they are now suffixed with <code>_tag</code> to make it clear that they are a different mode of operation. The type-based operations are no longer suffixed with <code>_type</code>, because they are now the default.</li>
<li><code>nakago</code> - The <code>inject</code> namespace has been promoted to the top level. Where <code>nakago::inject</code> was used before, <code>nakago</code> should now be the equivalent.</li>
<li><code>nakago</code> - The <code>config</code> utilities were moved to <code>nakago-figment</code>.</li>
<li><code>nakago-examples-simple</code>, <code>nakago-examples-async-graphql</code>, <code>nakago-examples-simple-warp</code> - Updated with the new approach. See these examples for more information about how to use the tools mentioned above.</li>

<ul>
<li><code>nakago-axum</code> - Added a new <code>Inject</code> extractor to access dependencies in your Axum handlers. This is a much more idiomatic way to use Nakago with Axum, and it's more flexible than the previous approach. Use the provided Axum <code>State</code> to make the <code>Inject</code> container available to your handlers.</li>
<li><code>nakago-figment</code> - Generic config utilities extracted from the core <code>nakago</code> package.</li>
