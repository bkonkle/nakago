## Welcome to Nakago

I created Nakago to help organize my Rust projects and cut down on boilerplate code as my applications grew larger. I wanted a framework that would allow me to focus on the business logic of my applications, while providing a solid foundation for the rest of the code.

I've had great experiences in other language ecosystems with frameworks like Django in Python and Nest.js in TypeScript. I wanted to bring some of the same ideas to Rust, while taking advantage of the unique features of the language.

Nakago is a lightweight framework for building Rust applications with a modular structure, taking advantage of dependency injection and lifecycle events to bring organization and testability to Rust projects large and small.

### Documentation & Examples

Check out the [Documentation](/docs/intro) and [Examples](/docs/examples) to learn more about how to use Nakago. A 10-minute tutorial is coming soon, and stay tuned for videos on YouTube and Twitch as I begin to share my experiences with Nakago.
